It is a custom screener for selected stocks mainly developed for backtesting and adjusting your behaviour for different situations in the market.

For example, it is common to buy stocks during the market correction but it is a challenge to pick a right time and enter. During these moments a buyer usually focuses across multiple charts and even indicators to get a clue how everything is going. It is time consuming exhausting and stressful.

This screener designed mostly for my personal purposes allows to see several stocks simultaniously whether they are performing good or not. During bearish markets it makes more obvoius to catch a rebounding moment and jump to bullish stocks. Most bullish stocks are sorted to the top.

For now only one indicator is used for sorting but I speciafically made it extendable.

Similar screeners are available at Investing.com and Tradingview but having own is better.
